<h2>What is strategic generation?</h2>

<p><b>Strategic generation</b> is the stage of a generation system that
decides what to say, compared to the tactical generation component,
that decides how to say it.  It involves selecting the relevant
content to include in the output (<b>Content Selection</b>) and
imposing an order to it (<b>Document Structuring</b>).</p>

<p>The name <i>strategic generation</i> and the division into two
modules is one of the eldest architectures in NLG. Current generation
architectures divide the system into at least three modules, text
planning (the strategic generation component), sentence planning and
surface realization (the tactical generation component). The <a
href="http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/projects/rags/overview.html">RAGS
project</a> is a recent example of a concensus architecture.</p>

<a name="schema_def"><h2>What are schemata?</h2></a>

<p>Document Structuring Schemata are a means to do strategic
generation.  Starting from a pool of coarsely relevant knowledge (the
<i>relevant knowledge pool</i>).</p>

<p>In her work, McKeown analyzed a number of texts in different genre
(all of expository in nature) and found out four different
organizational strategies that captured a large number of texts.  She
termed these four strategies as ``schemata.'' and defined them as</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>(...) a representation of a standard pattern of discourse
    structure which efficiently encodes a set of communicative
    techniques that a speaker can use for a particular discourse
    purpose. It defines a particular organizing principle for text and
    is used to structure the information that will be included in the
    answer. It is used to <b>guide</b> the generation process,
    controlling decisions of what to say when in the text.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=right>(McKeown, 1985, p.20)</p>

<p>Schemata are grammars with terminals in a language of <b>rhetorical
predicates</b>. The four schemata identified by McKeown on her work
are the <b>attributive, identification, constituency,</b> and
<b>compare and contrast</b> schemata.</p>
