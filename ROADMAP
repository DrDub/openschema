OPENSCHEMA ROADMAP

current status: pre-alpha

release pre-alpha0.04


Milestones:

* python-like language Java parsing

The perl script to parse the python-like schemata should be moved to
Java.



** Alpha will occur here



* Property language, CSP engines

The property language as defined currently is too much in the air.
The whole problem of finding values satisfying the list of constraints
is that of solving constraint satisfaction programs (CSP).  There are
a number of CSP engines available, OpenSchema can well rely upon them
for computing the values.


* Variable bindings

The variable bindings used currently in OpenSchema are quite fluffy.
A syntactic definition is desireable.



** Beta will occur here



* FrameSet SQL binding

Provide a class that instantiates the FrameSet interface from an
SQL-backend (note that knowledge about the structure of the knowledge
base will be needed to make it work).


* Schema to XSL compilation

Even if a matter of debate, the expressive power of XSL can be enough
to represent schemata. An implementation of schemata that compiles to
XSL can be useful to deploy schema without using any instantiation
engine besides the XSL one.


* Integration with existing Java template-based systems

Strategic generation can well be incorporated into template-based
systems. Such systems can be primary users of OpenSchema.


* Integration with jFUF and OpenCCG

More complex NLG systems will require a surface realizer. There are
two available under open licenses (jFUF and OpenCCG). Integrating them
within OpenSchema provides a sketch of a full-fledge NLG system under
GPL.



** production release
