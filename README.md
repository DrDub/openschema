OpenSchema
==========

OpenSchema provides a declarative implementation of (McKeown 1985)
document structuring schemata. Schemata are a widespread strategic
generation solution, targetting texts where the structure has got
fixed after a period of time (so no reasoning process can re-create
this structure).

See http://openschema.sf.net for more information and examples.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
